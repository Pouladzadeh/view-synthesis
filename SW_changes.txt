VS2_2 -> VS2_3
Date            : 27th June, 2008
Changes         :
- Z_near and Z_far values of left and right views are assigned independently.
- In warping.cpp file, cvAddWeighted(dst, alpha, dst2, 1-alpha, 1, dst2) was replaced with cvAddWeighted(dst, 1-alpha, dst2, alpha, 0, dst2).
- In warping.cpp file, camera name searching method was modified as follows. 
(p=strstr(s1, s2)) == NULL -> (p=strstr(s1, s2)) == NULL || (strlen(s1) != strlen(s2))
param.close() and param.open(filename) were added.
